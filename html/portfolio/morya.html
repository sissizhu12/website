            <p class="popout_left_col"> Morya Jewelry prides itself on sustainable and futuristic designs that elevate the everyday outfits.
            For its initial launch, the co-founders wanted a few jewelry products readily available for purchase.
            <br><br>
            I joined the team as a jewelry designer to realize Morya's vision with hard metals like chrome, recycled plastic, and crystals.

        <div class="center_text">
        <p>Throughout the design process, one problem I considered was balancing the Morya vision with consumer needs.
        Did consumers have aesthetic preferences in line with the sustainability values and style of Morya?
        Thus, to support design decisions, I conducted <strong>user research</strong>
        through online secondary data and offline discussions. 
        <br><br>
        My deliverables were product designs that were to be sent to a 3D modeller and potential manufacturers for creating prototypes, so I made sure to
        clearly present products with key details.</p>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?<br>(user research)</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>To investigate public interest in sustainability and sustainable fashion, I looked at <strong>Google search queries</strong> from 2004-2024 in Canada and the US.
                I noticed an <strong>increasing interest in sustainability</strong> in both countries, as indicated by an upward trajectory of total searches especially in the last two years.
                <br><br>Additionally, when considering closely related search terms to "sustainable," many keywords with the biggest increase in search frequency
                are contextualized within sustainable fashion or brands.
                <br><br>Ultimately, this suggests that consumers are becoming more sustainability conscious, which may be aided by growth
                in sustainable brands in fashion, makeup, and jewelry (ie Reformation, Mejuri, Patagonia, etc.).

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>To understand Morya's target demographic of young adults, I conducted <strong>preliminary consumer research</strong> with two North American social network platforms
                with widely different user demographics: Reddit and Pinterest.<br><br>On Pinterest, I analysed the top ten most popular "jewelry" inspiration boards.
                I found that jewelry in those boards tended to be metal based and lean into naturalistic stones and intricate styles as opposed to
                simple, diamond encrusted, and minimal jewelry. <br><br>Considering that Pinterest is dominated by female users 18-34 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1300092/pinterest-global-audience-by-age-group-and-gender/">(Stacy Jo Dixon, 2024),</a>
                this suggests that there is a young female demographic whose preferences line up with with Morya's vision of crystals, metals, and intricate jewelry.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>curating informed user personas</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Due to Reddit's demographic skewing male and 18-29 years of age, I reviewed several forums on men's fashion or jewelry
                to understand jewelry preferences and pain points for the young male demographic.<br><br>
                Combining my research on Pinterest and Reddit with <strong>qualitative data</strong> from discussions with female and male friends,
                I was able to use the overall research to form <strong>two largely different user personas.</strong> <br><br> Ultimately, the personas
                helped me organize ideas of who I was designing for and product qualities to be aware of. This included jewelry wearers with <strong>motor accessibility
                or sensitive skin needs</strong>, whose experiences I learned about through the research process.

        <h2><em>reflection</em></h2><br>
        <p class="popout_text">Overall, creating jewelry designs for Morya was a great exercise in considering a physical design problem with material constraints and designing accordingly.</p>
        <p><br><br>I found it incredibly helpful to <strong>ground my designs in the research</strong> I conducted, and I also learned to appreciate other jewelry designs as inspiration or exemplars for my own designs.
        Because it was my first time designing a physical product that moves with its user and I didn't have immediate access to prototyping, I looked to a wide range of jewelry to study their structure and physical integrity.
        It was exciting to learn about different forms of jewelry and crafting methods, and although the project didn't move forward due to Morya ceasing operations,  I would've loved to iterate further over prototypes based on my initial designs.
