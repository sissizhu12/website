        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>Morya Jewelry prides itself on <strong>sustainable and futuristic designs</strong> that elevate the everyday outfits.
        I was brought on as a jewelry designer to realize their vision with hard metals like <strong>chrome, recycled plastic, and crystals.</strong>
        <br><br>The product designs I created with these materials were to be sent to a 3D modeller and potential manufacturers for prototyping, so I made sure to
        consider the presentation and clarity of the all sketches. 
        To support the designs, I also conducted <strong>user research</strong> through online secondary data and real life discussions.</p>

            <p>To gauge public interest in sustainability and sustainable fashion, I looked at <strong>Google search queries</strong> from 2004-2024 in Canada and the US.
                I noticed an <strong>increasing interest in sustainability</strong> in both countries, as indicated by an upward trajectory of total searches especially in the last two years.
                <br><br>Additionally, when considering closely related search terms to "sustainable," many keywords with the biggest increase in search frequency
                are contextualized within sustainable fashion or brands.
                <br><br>Ultimately, this suggests that consumers are becoming more sustainability conscious, which may be aided by growth
                in sustainable brands in fashion, makeup, and jewelry (ie Reformation, Mejuri, Patagonia, etc.).

            <p>To understand Morya's target demographic of young adults, I conducted <strong>preliminary consumer research</strong> with two North American social network platforms
                with widely different user demographics: Reddit and Pinterest.<br><br>On Pinterest, I analysed the top ten most popular "jewelry" inspiration boards.
                I found that jewelry in those boards tended to be metal based and lean into naturalistic stones and intricate styles as opposed to
                simple, diamond encrusted, and minimal jewelry. <br><br>Considering that Pinterest is dominated by female users 18-34 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1300092/pinterest-global-audience-by-age-group-and-gender/">(Stacy Jo Dixon, 2024),</a>
                this suggests that there is a young female demographic whose preferences line up with with Morya's vision of crystals, metals, and intricate jewelry.

        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Due to Reddit's demographic skewing male and 18-29 years of age, I reviewed several forums on men's fashion or jewelry
                to understand jewelry preferences and pain points for the young male demographic.<br><br>
                Combining my research on Pinterest and Reddit with <strong>qualitative data</strong> from discussions with female and male friends,
                I was able to use the overall research to form <strong>two largely different user personas.</strong> <br><br> Ultimately, the personas
                helped me organize ideas of who I was designing for and product qualities to be aware of. This included jewelry wearers with <strong>motor accessibility
                or sensitive skin needs</strong>, whose experiences I learned about through the research process.

        <p>Overall, creating jewelry designs for Morya was a great opportunity to <strong>consider a physical design problem with material constraints </strong> and design accordingly.
        <br><br>I found it incredibly helpful to <strong>ground my designs in the research</strong> I conducted, and I also learned to appreciate other jewelry designs as inspiration or exemplars for my own designs.
        Because it was my first time designing a physical product that moves with its user, I looked to wide range of jewelry to study their structure and physical integrity.
