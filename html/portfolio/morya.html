            In 2 months, I conducted product research and generated 13 product designs.<br><br>
            For Morya's initial brand launch, I finalized 3 designs, with an expected revenue of $12k.

        <p><strong>Do consumers have preferences in line with Morya's vision?</strong><br><br>
        This was a burning question I had from the start. To better understand the target demographic, I conducted product research
        with online secondary data and consumer interviews. 
        <br><br>
        This analysis later supported design decisions for better usability, accessibility, and market fit.

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="center_text">
            <p>To investigate consumer interest in sustainability, I looked at <strong>Google search queries</strong>.
            I noticed an <strong>increasing interest in sustainability</strong> based on total US and Canadian searches.
            <br><br>Many of these searches were contextualized with looking up fashion or clothing brands, which shows there are sustainable fashion buyers for Morya to target.
            Rising competitors in sustainable fashion like Reformation, Mejuri, and Patagonia also reflect this demand.

        <div class="project_text">
            <p>To understand one of Morya's demographics, young women, I conducted <strong>consumer analysis</strong> Pinterest, which is dominated by 
            women 18-24 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1300092/pinterest-global-audience-by-age-group-and-gender/">(Stacy Jo Dixon, 2024).</a>
            <br><br>
            Looking at the ten most popular "jewelry" inspiration boards, I noticed that saved jewelry was often metal, intricate, and had naturalistic stones.
            <br><br>
            This suggests Morya's vision of crystals, metals, and intricate jewelry aligns with this demographic.

            <p> In addition to my Pinterest and Reddit research, I interviewed female and male friends to ask about their experiences purchasing and wearing jewelry.
            I then synergized my findings by creating <strong>two user personas.</strong><br><br> The personas
            helped me organize ideas of important product factors and who I was designing for. This included jewelry wearers with <strong> budget constraints, aesthetic preferences, motor accessibility needs

        <p class="popout_text">Crafting Morya's jewelry designs allowed me to use product research to help solve a complex and physical design problem.</p>
        <p><br><br>Outside of consumer research, I referenced other jewelry and physical products that move with its user. I learned so much about crafting processes and the jewelry industry.
        Although the initiative didn't move forward due to Morya ceasing operations,  I would've loved to iterate further over prototypes based on my initial product designs.
