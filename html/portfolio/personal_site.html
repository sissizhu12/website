            to design and code a unique portfolio.<br><br>I wanted to not only showcase my case studies and design skills, but also learn more about website navigation, conception, and digital accessibility.

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="center_text">
            <p>To orient the project scope, I constrained myself to avoid using website templates, frameworks, and external plugins to build the site.
            The intention was to deepen my knowledge of the basic building blocks of web applications: HTML and CSS.
            I also set internal deadlines to stick to, which was helpful for the longevity of the project!

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?<br>(research to build a persona)</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>I knew that generally speaking, viewers of my portfolio would be job recruiters, HR, or even potential clients looking to gauge my skillset.
                <br><br>To better understand their needs and pain points when navigating portfolio websites, I did <strong>secondary research</strong> through articles, videos, and interviews.
                I then assembled a <strong>user persona</strong> for the most frequent kind of visitor: a recruiter or HR viewing my portfolio website.

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>I then asked myself <strong>how and what content should be organized</strong> on the website for easy content navigation.
            To explore options and see meaningful connections, I started by <strong>sorting website content into groups.</strong>
            <br><br>This exercise also made me consider what content was most and least important to showcase.

        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>When organizing the content into a more detailed user flow chart, I realized that I would need to make sure that
                users could quickly navigate and differentiate the pages to find what they're looking for.<br><br>
                Because the most popular <strong>website entry points</strong> would be the home page or the portfolio page, I needed to make sure those pages especially had a <strong>visually salient and consistent navigation bar.</strong>
                <br><br>This insight ultimately helped guide my initial designs.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>when in doubt, sketch it out</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>To <strong>optimise the website layout responsiveness</strong>, I realized two key guidelines:</p><br>
            <ol>
                <li>The layout of photos, videos, and embeds must flexibly scale with similar screen ratios</li><br>
                <li> Webpage navigation can’t overly rely on vertical scrolling</li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>Through <strong>explorative sketches</strong>, I found a solution of using different navigation bars
            and content layouts depending on screen size.</p>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p> For <strong>visual inspiration</strong>, I drew on images from my short film “Dream” due to its vibrant and dreamy colours.
            <br><br>I wanted to use the images as a theme to show my introspective personality, so I created <strong>initial wireframes in Figma</strong> based on the colour palette and tone.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>refining my coding skills</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>After getting a clear visual plan, I built out the designs in code.
            Throughout the process, I practiced design skills <strong> and key coding skills:</strong></p><br>
                <li>Using Git for version control and regular commits (<a href="https://github.com/sissizhu12/website">gh/sissizhu12/website</a>)</li><br>
                <li>Organizing files and structuring code with comments</li><br>
                <li>Setup of automatic website deployment on GitHub workflows</li><br>
                <li>HTML and CSS strategies for responsive webpages</li><br></div>

    <div class="project_popout">
        <h2><em>reflection</em></h2><br>
        <p class="popout_text"> Because I conducted all research, designing, and coding, I saw hidden connections 
        between each role. This led me to better understand the worlds of design and code as collaborative
        rather than independent.</p>
        <p><br>This project also made me appreciate both sides more, as I often moved back and forth between designing and coding, giving me new insights from one role to support the other.
        For instance, I found annotated sketches to be helpful visual guides for adding or debugging code. As a result, I also learned first-hand the communication value of clear design documentation for handoff to coders.
