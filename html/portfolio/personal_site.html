        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>Back to basics: Creating this website helped me better <strong>understand the worlds of design and code as collaborative rather than independent.</strong>
        I also gained a deeper understanding of the building blocks of websites,  HTML and CSS, which brought me new insights as a website designer.
        Furthermore, it was exciting to go through a complete process of understanding the purpose of portfolio websites, brainstorming for my own, and both designing
        and coding my plans for this project.
        <br><br>
        To orient myself for the long term, I initially set <strong>two main goals</strong> for myself:
        </p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Code the website from scratch <strong>without using external plugins or templates</strong></li>
            <li>Dig deep to learn about the proper <strong>setup and maintenance of websites</strong></li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>First, I assembled a <strong>user persona</strong> for the HR or recruiter viewing my portfolio website.
                <br><br> To understand the needs and pain points, I did <strong>secondary research</strong> through articles, videos, <br>and interviews.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="/media/projects/website/user persona.png" alt="two column user persona card with a photo of a woman wearing a suit and smiling on the left.
            text with the image reads 'User Persona...Melissa the Observant... Occupation: Recruiter/HR' and the right column contains text outling the goals, behavior, and opportunity for the persona.">
    </div>
        
        <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>Similarly, I asked myself <strong>how and what content should be organized</strong> on the website.
                To explore my options and see meaningful connections, I <strong>sorted content into groups.</strong>
                <br><br>This exercise also made me consider what content was most and least important to showcase.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="/media/projects/website/sorting.png" alt=" a digital board of post-it notes of website content organized into three categories: 'home page', 'portfolio', and 'personal page.'
            text at the very top reads 'What content should be presented together on each webpage?' with an upwards facing arrow next to the post-its labeled 'increasing importance.'">
        </div>
        
        <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>When organizing the content into a more detailed user flow chart, I realized that I would need to make sure that
                    users could quickly navigate and differentiate the pages to find what they're looking for.<br><br>
                    Because the most popular <strong>website entry points</strong> would be the home page or the portfolio page, I needed to make sure those pages especially had a <strong>visually salient and consistent navigation bar.</strong>
                    <br><br>This insight ultimately helped guide my initial designs.

            having arrows that connect to a box reading 'navigation bar on all pages.'
            text at the very top reads 'Website User Flow...How will users navigate the site?How connected will pages be?'">
        </div>
        
        <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p> For <strong>visual inspiration</strong>, I drew on images from my short film “Dream” due to its vibrant and dreamy colours.
                <br><br>I wanted to use the images as a theme to show my introspective personality, so I created <strong>initial wireframes in Figma</strong> that referenced the colour palette and tone.

        <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>To <strong>optimise the website layout responsiveness</strong>, I realized two key guidelines:</p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The layout of photos, videos, and embeds must flexibly scale with similar screen ratios</li><br>
                    <li> Webpage navigation can’t overly rely on vertical scrolling</li><br>
                </ol>
                <p>Through <strong>explorative sketches</strong>, I found a solution of using different navigation bars
                and content layouts depending on screen size. At this point, I started building out the layout in code and trying variations.</p>

            <div class="project_text" style="width:100%">
                <p>Through the website development, I practiced not only design skills but <strong>key coding skills also:</strong></p><br>
                    <li>Using Git for version control and regular commits (<a href="https://github.com/sissizhu12/website">gh/sissizhu12/website</a>)</li><br>
                    <li>Organizing files and structuring code with comments</li><br>
                    <li>Setup of automatic website deployment on GitHub workflows</li><br>
                    <li>HTML and CSS strategies for responsive webpages</li><br>
                <p>In sum, this project made me appreciate the coding side of website development more.
                I often moved back and forth between designing and coding,
                <strong>giving me new insights from one role to support the other.</strong>
