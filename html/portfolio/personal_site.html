        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p class="popout_text">When creating this portfolio website from scratch, my initial goal was to leverage the full creative freedom
        to build a unique portfolio. I also wanted to engage with and explore website navigation, conception, and accessibility more deeply.</p>
        <br><h1>my role</h1><br>
        <p> I conducted all research, designing, coding, and gathering feedback, which ultimately allowed me to 
        see the connections between each role and brought me new insights as a website designer.<strong> Most importantly, I learned to understand the worlds of design and code as collaborative
        rather than independent.</strong>
        </p>
        <br><h1>the challenge</h1><br>
        <p>My main goal was to avoid using external plugins, website templates, or frameworks.
        The intention was to deepen my knowledge of the building blocks of web applications: HTML and CSS.
        I also set internal deadlines to stick to, which was helpful for the longevity of the project!
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?<br>(research to build a persona)</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
            <div class="project_text">
                <p>I knew that generally speaking, viewers of my portfolio would be job recruiters, HR, or even potential clients looking to gauge my skillset.
                <br><br>To better understand their needs and pain points when navigating portfolio websites, I did <strong>secondary research</strong> through articles, videos, and interviews.
                I then assembled a <strong>user persona</strong> for the most frequent kind of visitor: a recruiter or HR viewing my portfolio website.
                </p>

            <img src="/media/projects/website/user persona.png" alt="two column user persona card with a photo of a woman wearing a suit and smiling on the left.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>exploring webflow with card sorting</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>I then asked myself <strong>how and what content should be organized</strong> on the website for easy content navigation.
            To explore options and see meaningful connections, I started by <strong>sorting website content into groups.</strong>
            <br><br>This exercise also made me consider what content was most and least important to showcase.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/sorting.png" alt=" a digital board of post-it notes of website content organized into three categories: 'home page', 'portfolio', and 'personal page.'
        text at the very top reads 'What content should be presented together on each webpage?' with an upwards facing arrow next to the post-its labeled 'increasing importance.'">
    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>When organizing the content into a more detailed user flow chart, I realized that I would need to make sure that
                users could quickly navigate and differentiate the pages to find what they're looking for.<br><br>
                Because the most popular <strong>website entry points</strong> would be the home page or the portfolio page, I needed to make sure those pages especially had a <strong>visually salient and consistent navigation bar.</strong>
                <br><br>This insight ultimately helped guide my initial designs.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>when in doubt, sketch it out</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>To <strong>optimise the website layout responsiveness</strong>, I realized two key guidelines:</p><br>
            <ol>
                <li>The layout of photos, videos, and embeds must flexibly scale with similar screen ratios</li><br>
                <li> Webpage navigation can’t overly rely on vertical scrolling</li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>Through <strong>explorative sketches</strong>, I found a solution of using different navigation bars
            and content layouts depending on screen size.</p>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>'test driving' the visual inspiration</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p> For <strong>visual inspiration</strong>, I drew on images from my short film “Dream” due to its vibrant and dreamy colours.
            <br><br>I wanted to use the images as a theme to show my introspective personality, so I created <strong>initial wireframes in Figma</strong> based on the colour palette and tone.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>refining my coding skills</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>After getting a clear visual plan, I built out the designs in code.
            Throughout the process, I practiced design skills <strong> and key coding skills:</strong></p><br>
                <li>Using Git for version control and regular commits (<a href="https://github.com/sissizhu12/website">gh/sissizhu12/website</a>)</li><br>
                <li>Organizing files and structuring code with comments</li><br>
                <li>Setup of automatic website deployment on GitHub workflows</li><br>
                <li>HTML and CSS strategies for responsive webpages</li><br></div>

    <div class="project_popout">
        <h2><em>reflection</em></h2><br>
        <p class="popout_text"> Working both roles of coding and design taught me how design and code depend on each other throughout the process of building digital tools.</p>
        <p><br>This project made me appreciate both sides more, as I often moved back and forth between designing and coding, giving me new insights from one role to support the other.
        For instance, I often returned to sketching when coding to help visualize, debug, or adjust design plans if they didn't practically pan out the way I anticipated.
        Similarly, I learned what design elements are crucial to have planned out before starting to code versus what kinds of details are more flexible and can be adjusted later on.
