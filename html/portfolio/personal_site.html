        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>Back to Basics: Building this website helped me better understand the worlds of design and code as collaborative rather than independent.
        I also gained a deeper understanding of the building blocks of websites,  HTML and CSS, which brought me new insights as a website designer.
        <br><br>
        To orient myself for the long term, I initially set two main goals for myself:
        </p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Code the website from scratch without using external plugins or templates</li>
            <li>Dig deep to learn about the proper setup and maintenance of websites</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <h2><em>how did I get started?</em></h2><br>
        <div class="body_content">
            <p>First, I assembled a user persona for my portfolio website to understand the HR or recruiter perspective on hiring.
            Focusing on exploring wants, needs, and pain points, I did research through articles, watching videos, and interviews.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/user persona.png">

        <div class="body_content">
            <p>Similarly, I asked myself how and what content should be organized on the website.
            To explore my options and see meaningful connections, I sorted content into groups.
            This exercise also made me consider what content should live at the forefront of the page and what content is less important to showcase.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/sorting.png">

        <div class="body_content">
            <p>When organizing the content into a more detailed user flow chart, I realized that I would need to make sure that
                users could quickly navigate and differentiate the pages to find what they're looking for.
                Because the most popular entry points of my website would to be the home page or the portfolio page itself, I needed to make sure the navigation was visually salient and consistent on those pages;
                this insight ultimately helped guide my initial designs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/webflow.png">

        <div class="body_content">
            <p> For visual inspiration, I was guided by images taken from my short film “Dream” due to its vibrant and dreamy colours.
                I wanted to use the images as a theme to show my introspective personality, so I created mockups in Figma that referenced its colour palette and feeling. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/inspo board.png">

        <div class="body_content">
            <p>To optimise responsive design, I realized two key guidelines:
                <ol>
                    <li>The layout of photos, videos, and embeds should scale well with screen size</li>
                    <li> Webpage navigation shouldn’t overly rely on vertical scrolling</li>
                </ol>
                Through explorative sketches and mockups, I decided to use slightly different navigation bars
                and content layout depending on screen size.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/website/sketches.png">

        <div class="body_content">
            <p>Through the development of my website, I thoroughly learned some good coding practices:
                <li>Using Git for version control (<a href="https://github.com/sissizhu12/website">gh/sissizhu12/website</a>)</li>
                <li> Ensuring regular and organized commits</li>
                <li>Proper coding practices such as comments and file organization</li>
                <li>Proper setup of automatic website deployment on GitHub workflows</li>
                <li>Appropriate HTML and CSS strategies for responsive webpages</li>
            In sum, this experience made me appreciate the coding side of website development more.
            I found myself moving back and forth between designing and coding,
            which allowed me to use new insights from one role to support the other.
