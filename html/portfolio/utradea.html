        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>During my time at Utradea, an investing analytics platform, I worked on the website and mobile app interface designs.
           In order to present rich and complex data to Utradea users, I learned to <strong>design with visual clarity</strong> as the highest priority.
           <br><br>One challenge I worked on was redesigning the pricing plans page, where the lack of visual organization made
           information cluttered and difficult to quickly parse; this was supported by looking at the <strong>webpage heatmap of user mouse movement</strong> and <strong>LogRocket user statistics</strong>. Users
           often hovered over large text and stayed a short amount of time on the page, resulting in substantially less mouse actions in less salient areas and lower on the page.

            <div class="project_text">
                <p> Considering the goal of the pricing plans page is to inform and showcase tiers of memberships plans and their benefits, I wanted to explore the <strong>existing user research literature </strong> on pricing pages or product pages.
                This was to compensate for the fact that Utradea didn't conduct A/B testing on webpages due to lack of resources and training.
                <br><br>
                Two helpful resources I consulted included articles from the Nielson Nelson Group and Vitaly Friedman, which helped me <strong>understanding current strategies and important factors</strong> for product and plan pages.

            <p> Based on what I learned, I created simple <strong>iterative sketches</strong> to explore how to best capture differences between the three membership tiers.
            <br><br> Ultimately, after a discussion with my design lead and receiving feedback, I decided to move forward with version C to <strong>avoid visual clutter</strong> with too many icons.

            <p>I also mocked up various buttons and toggles for users to navigate between monthly and annual prices. 
            Comparing them next to each other, I found that main action buttons stand out more because of the dark background.   
            <br><br> Moreover, the centered positioning and highlighted button seemed both cohesive and salient within the surrounding design elements, so my design team and I moved forward with the third option.

            <p>To highlight the attractiveness of the highest tier membership and its limited free trial, I iterated sketches and mockups of icons and banners.
            <br><br> They didn’t make it onto the final pricing plans page so as to not distract from the coloured call to action buttons, but it was helpful to test the idea out visually.

            <p>Although the extent of the task was to focus on design, I felt that it reflected a need for Utradea to commit to more active user research to support its design.
            <br><br>Thus, to help advocate for future organizational research, I worked on a survey to gather quantitative and qualitative data on users' pain points, gains, and experiences with the general Utradea interface.
            Ideally, this would help uncover insights on the who, how, and why of Utradea users.
