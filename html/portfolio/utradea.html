            <p> <strong> When a pricing page is visually disorganized and hard to skim, it lowers sales.</strong>
                <br><br>Looking at the Logrocket statistics and heatmap for user mouse movement, 
                I noticed that users spent too little time on the page to engage with important pricing details.
                <br><br>
                And the areas they did engage with were not key information: large text and visual elements.
                Important areas that were text heavy, less visually salient, and lower on the page were less engaged with.
                This meant much less clicks for those areas too, including purchase buttons, which directly translates to lower sales.

        <p><br><strong>To advocate for more internal research,</strong> I created a preliminary survey to gather quantitative and qualitative data on Utradea users' interface experience and pain points.
        This would ideally help guide Utradea's future website and app design decisions.
        <br><br>With the support of organization stakeholders, the survey was released to the public and used to collect insights.
