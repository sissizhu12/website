        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>During my time at Utradea, an investing analytics platform, I worked on the website and mobile app interface designs as a UI/UX designer.
           In order to present rich and complex data to Utradea users, I learned to <strong>design with visual clarity</strong> as the highest priority.
           <br><br>One challenge I worked on was redesigning the pricing plans page, where the <strong>lack of visual organization</strong> likely made
           information cluttered and difficult to quickly parse. This was indicated by the <strong>webpage heatmap for user mouse movement</strong> and <strong>LogRocket user statistics</strong>. Users
           often stayed a short amount of time on the page and typically hovered over large text without much engagement with more detailed or text heavy areas. 
           resulting in substantially less mouse actions in less salient areas and lower on the page.
           <br><br> Since the membership plan details occupied the less mouse hovered areas, it was possible that users weren't processing or interested in those details,
           which may contribute to <strong>purchase friction.</strong>

            <div class="project_text">
                <p> Considering the goal of the pricing plans page is to inform and showcase tiers of memberships plans and their benefits, I wanted to explore the <strong>existing user research literature </strong> on pricing pages or product pages.
                This was to compensate for the fact that Utradea didn't conduct A/B testing on webpages due to lack of resources and training.
                <br><br>
                Two helpful resources I consulted included articles from the Nielson Nelson Group and Vitaly Friedman, which helped me <strong>understanding current strategies and important factors</strong> for product and plan pages.

            <p> Based on what I learned, I created simple <strong>iterative sketches</strong> to explore how to best capture differences between the three membership tiers.
            <br><br> Ultimately, after a discussion with my design lead and receiving feedback, I decided to move forward with version C to <strong>avoid visual clutter</strong> with too many icons.

            <p>I also mocked up various buttons and toggles for users to <strong>navigate between monthly and annual prices.</strong> 
            Comparing them next to each other, my design team and I decided to move forward with the third option, as our goal 
            was to <strong> ensure the toggle button was salient enough for users to click on.</strong> Due to its coloured outline
            and center alignment on the page, the third option was comparatively the most noticeable.

            <p>To highlight the attractiveness of the highest tier membership and its limited free trial, I iterated sketches and mockups of icons and banners.
            <br><br> They didn’t make it onto the final pricing plans page due to distracting from the call to action purchase buttons, but it was <strong>helpful to visually test out the idea.</strong>

        <div class="project_text" style="width:100%">
            <p>Although the extent of my task was to focus mainly on design and minimally on research, I felt that <strong>my experience reflected a need for more active user research</strong> to further understand design flaws and solutions.
            <br><br>Thus, to help advocate for more organizational research, I worked on a <strong>preliminary survey to gather quantitative and qualitative data</strong> on users' pain points, gains, and experiences with the general Utradea interface.
            This would help uncover insights on the who, how, and why of Utradea users and <strong>help guide Utradea's future design decisions.</strong>
