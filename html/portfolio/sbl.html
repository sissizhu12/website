    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="center_text">
            <p> Due to time constraints, SBL opted to use a Shopify website template for the base design. I was brought on the project to improve the user experience with
            my design and coding skills. <strong>My two goals were:</strong><br><br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify design opportunities to better communicate the SBL brand identity</li>
                <li>Customize the website with code to build out design choices</li>
            </ol>
            <p><br>Due to its existing design and code structure, working with a finished website template <strong>(shown below)</strong> heavily limits new modifications.
            Thus, before designing, I familiarized myself with Liquid, Shopify’s web templating language, to understand the extent of possible changes that I could make.
            The learning process included analyzing the code organization beforehand and the language itself on the fly.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?<br>(user and competitor research)</em><br></h2>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="center_text">
            <p>I started by analysing the audience of the SBL Instagram account.
            Using InsTrack, a third party tool, I got the insight that statistically speaking,
            their followers are most likely female, live in Canada (GTA) or the US (NYC), and English speaking.
            <br><br>This quantitative data indicated the main demographic of their online followers and potential customers.
            However, it left <strong>unanswered questions about high level behavior</strong> and qualitative traits
            of SBL customers. 
            </p>

    <div class="center_image" id ="sbl_stats_card">
        <img src="/media/projects/sbl/stats card.png" alt="collage of statistics of most frequent languages, countries, and gender demographic of Slow Burn Leather Instagram account" width="40%">
    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="center_text">
            <p>Thus, to more deeply understand the typical SBL customer, I considered the offline events
            SBL promoted at, assuming that customer real-life behaviors at those events somewhat translate online.
            <br><br>
            When <strong>observing real-time interactions with customers at those events,</strong> I noticed two demographics of shoppers based on the dimension of product knowledge only.
            Newer customers often browsed more generally without much base understanding of the products and quickly lost interest without enough product information.
            <br><br>In constrast, more experienced or repeat customers often asked specific, experience-driven questions about products;
            likely making mental comparisons between current SBL products, their personal collection, and competitors' products.
            Based on these insights, I created <strong>group archetypes to capture these potential behavioral differences</strong> (shown on the right) to keep in mind when designing.

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p> When looking at <strong>competitor websites,</strong> I noticed that many have bright, playful colours and similar websites due to using the same Shopify templates.
            They can mainly be differentiated through product photos, typography, and logos,
            so one insight I realized was to use those elements to <strong>distinguish SBL's website from their competitors.</strong>
            <br><br>For instance, the SBL founder and my client wanted jewel tones or muted colours that weren’t too unapproachable.
            Based on the research, I suggested leaning into cooler or darker jewel tones to be visually distinctive from other brands.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>branding and accessibility</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Since the template layout couldn't be largely modified, my design approach was to <strong>use colour as a tool
            to speak about the brand identity.</strong> To keep the brand visually cohesive, I <strong>pulled colours from the existing brand logos.</strong>
            This can be seen in the initial sketches, where I played with colour combinations with the same purple and dark red shades from the logos.
            <br><br>I was also concerned about readability⁠ and visual accessibility, so I ran text and background colour combinations for all the iterative sketches
            through a <strong>colour contrast checker.</strong> This ensured the website colour theme met at least the basic Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG AA).

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>customisation with code</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text" id="sbl_custom_code_text">
            <p><strong>Due to working with an existing website template, implementing total design overhauls to cater to the archetypes was unfortunately not an option.</strong><br><br>
            However, in addition to double checking the quality of product photo and information, some aspects could be improved by visually emphasizing, swapping,
            or changing specific website elements. In sum, the custom changes I made  included:</p><br>
            <li>Updating font types, font sizes, and colours to be more readable or accessibility friendly</li>
            <li>Updating menu layout and incorporating gradient backgrounds</li>
            <li>Embedding SBL Instagram posts in the website footer</li>
            <li>Designing and adding graphic elements</li>

    <div class="project_popout">
        <h2><em>reflection</em></h2><br>
        <p class="popout_text">Overall, the website customizations position the brand as bold and vibrant in appearance, but also poetically sensual.
        By allowing more personality to shine through, the website is more memorable and stands out better against competitors.</p>
        <p>
        <br>Because the product photos and the Instagram embedded posts feature the founder and face of the brand, these 
        elements also work to humanize SBL and increase approachability and connection with consumers. As such, this project allowed me <strong>strategically use research, consumer psychology, design, and code</strong> to push a website's effectiveness or
        purpose further than just the aesthetic.
