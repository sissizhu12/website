    <div class ="project_popout">
        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>Slow Burn Leather (SBL) is a Toronto-based small business that makes leather accessories for both fashion and play.
        <strong>To create their ecommerce website, they opted for a Shopify website template due to time constraints and brought me on to improve the website UX.</strong>
        For this project, my two goals were:</strong><br><br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Design a memorable website that clearly communicates the SBL brand identity</li>
            <li>Customize a Shopify template with code to bring more personality to the website</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>My main challenge was working with a finished website template (shown below), which heavily limited website design modification due to its existing design and code structure.</strong>
        Thus, before designing, I familiarized myself with Liquid, Shopify’s web templating language, to fully understand how much I could customize the website.
        This included learning the organization and language of existing code.
            </p><br>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?<br>(user and competitor research)</em><br></h2>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>I started by analysing the audience of the SBL Instagram business account.
            Using InsTrack, a third party tool, I got the insight that statistically speaking,
            their followers are most likely female, live in Canada (GTA) or the US (NYC), and English speaking.
            <br><br>This quantitative information indicated the main demographic of their online followers and potential customers.
            However, it left many <strong>unanswered questions</strong> about the qualitative traits,
            including <strong>high level shopping behavior</strong> and attitudes of their customer base. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/sbl/stats card.png" alt="collage of statistics of most frequent languages, countries, and gender demographic of Slow Burn Leather Instagram account">
    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Thus, to more deeply understand the typical SBL customer, I considered the offline events
            SBL promoted at, assuming that customer real-life behaviors at those events somewhat translate online.
            I noted that the events tend to be art markets and especially within the Toronto art and queer community.
            <br><br>
            When <strong>observing real-time interactions with customers,</strong> I also noticed two demographics of shoppers based on the dimension of product knowledge only.
            Newer customers often browsed more generally without much base understanding of the products and quickly lost interest without enough product information.
            <br><br>On the other hand, more experienced or repeat customers would often ask more specific questions about products,
            and I trust that they would be more likely to make comparisons between current SBL products, their personal collection, and competitors' products.
            When creating <strong>group archetypes to capture potential ecommerce behavioral differences,</strong> I dubbed them the "curious newbie" and the "seasoned savant."

    </div>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p> When looking at <strong>competitor websites,</strong> I noticed that many have bright, playful colours and similar websites due to using the same Shopify templates.
            They can mainly be differentiated through product photos, typography, and logos,
            so one insight I realized was to use those elements to <strong>distinguish my client's website from her competitors.</strong>
            <br><br>For instance, my client wanted jewel tones or muted colours that weren’t too unapproachable.
            Based on the research insight, I suggested leaning into cooler or darker jewel tones to be visually distinctive from
            other brands.

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>branding and accessibility</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Similarly, since the template layout centered on product photos and couldn't largely be modified, my main design approach was to <strong>use colour as a tool
            to speak about the brand identity.</strong> To keep the website visually cohesive, I used colour continuity by <strong>pulling colours from the existing brand logos.</strong>
            This can be seen in the initial sketches, where I played with colour combinations with the purple and dark red shades from the logos.
            <br><br>Moreover, because I was concerned about readability⁠ and visual accessibility across mobile and desktop versions,
            I ran text and background colour combinations for all the iterative sketches through a <strong>colour contrast checker.</strong>
            This ensured the website colour theme met at least the level two Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>customisation with code</em></h2><br>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p><strong> Due to working with an existing website template, implementing total design overhauls to cater to the archetypes was unfortunately not an option.</strong><br><br>
            However, in addition to especially considering product photos and information, some aspects could be improved by visually emphasizing, swapping,
            or changing specific website elements. In sum, the custom changes I made  included:</p><br>
            <li>Updating font types, font sizes, and colours to be more readable or accessibility friendly</li>
            <li>Updating menu layout and incorporating gradient backgrounds</li>
            <li>Embedding SBL Instagram posts in the website footer</li>
            <li>Designing and adding graphic elements</li>
        </div>

        <h2><em>reflection</em></h2><br>
        <p><strong>Overall, the website customizations allow more personality to shine through, which
        make the website and brand more memorable and stand out against competitors.</strong> It also positions the brand as bold and vibrant in appearance, but also poetically sensual.
        <br><br>Because the product photos and the Instagram embedded posts feature the founder and face of the brand, these 
        elements also work to humanize SBL more and increase approachability, which ideally helps different kinds of customers
        connect with the brand. <strong>As such, this project allowed me to learn about how to use research and consumer psychology to push a website's effectiveness or
        purpose further than just the aesthetic.
