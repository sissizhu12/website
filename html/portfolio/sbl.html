        <p>Morya Jewelry prides itself on <strong>sustainable and futuristic designs</strong> that elevate the everyday outfits.
        I was brought on as a jewelry designer to realize their vision with hard metals like <strong>chrome, recycled plastic, and crystals.</strong>
        <br><br>
        To support the designs, I also conducted <strong>user research</strong> through online secondary data and real life discussions.</p>

            <p>To gauge public interest in sustainability and sustainable fashion, I looked at <strong>Google search queries</strong> from 2004-2024 in Canada and the US.
                I noticed an <strong>increasing interest in sustainability</strong> in both countries, as indicated by an upward trajectory of total searches especially in the last two years.
                <br><br>Additionally, when considering closely related search terms to "sustainable," many keywords with the biggest increase in search frequency
                are contextualized within sustainable fashion or brands.
                <br><br>Ultimately, this suggests that consumers are becoming more sustainability conscious, which may be aided by growth
                in sustainable brands in fashion, makeup, and jewelry (ie Reformation, Mejuri, Patagonia, etc.).

            <p>My client’s preferred website platform was Shopify’s Dawn template, which limited website modification due to its existing design and code structure.
            Thus, before desigining, I familiarized myself with Liquid, Shopify’s web templating language, to fully understand how much I could customize the website.
            This included learning the organization of existing code and understanding the technical constraints for design modifications.

            <p> When looking at competitor websits, I noticed that many have bright, playful colours and similar websites due to using the same Shopify templates.
            They can mainly be differentiated through product photos, typography, and logos,
            so one insight I realized was to use those elements to distinguish my client's website from her competitors.
            <br><br>For instance, my client wanted jewel tones or muted colours that weren’t too unapproachable.
            Based on the research insight, I suggested leaning into cooler or darker jewel tones and centering the website around strong product photos to be visually distinctive from
            other brands.

        <div class="project_text">
            <p>As such, my main design approach was using memorable product photography
            as a focal point to guide the website aesthetic.
            This is helps express the unique brand identity, which emphasizes
            trademark craftsmanship and quality leatherwork.
            <br><br>To keep the brand identity visually cohesive, I considered colour continuity of the website with the existing brand logos.
            During my initial sketches, I played with colour combinations with the purple and dark red shades from the logos.

            <br><br>One concern I had for the website was readability⁠ across mobile and desktop versions and light and dark modes.
            To address the problem, I ran text and background colour combinations of all iterative sketches through a
            colour contrast checker. This ensured the website colour theme met at least the level two Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

            <p>Overall, the custom changes I made to the template included:</p><br>
                <li>Accessibility friendly font types, size, and colours</li>
                <li>Updated menu layout and gradient backgrounds</li>
                <li>Embedded SBL Instagram feed in the website footer</li>
                <li>Graphic hero image and addition of graphic elements</li>
            <br><p>These website customizations help humanize SBL more and allow personality to shine through.
            It also positions the brand as bold and vibrant in appearance, but also poetically sensual.
