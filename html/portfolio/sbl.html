    <div class ="project_popout">
        <h2><em>introduction</em></h2><br>
        <p>Slow Burn Leather (SBL) is a Toronto-based small business that makes leather accessories for both fashion and play.
        While working on their website, I faced <strong>two design objectives:</strong><br><br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Design a memorable website that clearly communicates the SBL <strong>brand identity</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Customize a Shopify template with code</strong> to bring more personality to the website</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>final website design</em></h2>
    <div class="design_images">
        <img src="/media/projects/sbl/sbl_final_desktop.png" id = "sbl_desktop_img">
        <img src="/media/projects/sbl/sbl_final_mobile.png" id = "sbl_mobile_img">
    </div>

    <h2 class ="center_headers"><em>how did I get started?</em></h2><br><br>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>I started by analysing the audience of the SBL Instagram business account.
            Using InsTrack, a third party tool, I got the insight that statistically speaking,
            their followers are most likely female, live in Canada (GTA) or the US (NYC), and English speaking.
            <br><br>This quantitative information indicated the main demographic of their online followers and potential customers.
            However, it left many <strong>unanswered questions</strong> about the qualitative traits,
            including <strong>high level shopping behavior</strong> and attitudes of their customer base. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/media/projects/sbl/stats card.png">
    </div>
    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Thus, to more deeply understand the typical SBL customer, I considered the offline events
            SBL promoted at, assuming that customer real-life behaviors at those events somewhat translate online.
            I noted that the events tend to be art markets and especially within the Toronto art and queer community.
            <br><br>
            When <strong>observing real-time interactions with customers,</strong> I also noticed two demographics of shoppers based on the dimension of product knowledge only.
            Newer customers often browsed more generally without much base understanding of the products and quickly lost interest without enough product information.
            <br><br>On the other hand, more experienced or repeat customers would often ask more specific questions about products,
            and I trust that they would be more likely to make comparisons between current SBL products, their personal collection, and competitors' products.
            When creating <strong>user personas for each group to capture potential ecommerce behavioral differences,</strong> I dubbed them the "curious newbie" and the "seasoned savant."

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>My client’s preferred platform was Shopify’s Dawn template, which limited website design modification due to its <strong>existing design and code structure.</strong>
            <br><br> Thus, before designing, I familiarized myself with Liquid, Shopify’s web templating language, to <strong>fully understand how much I could customize the website.</strong>
            This included learning the organization and language of existing code.
            </p>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p> When looking at <strong>competitor websites,</strong> I noticed that many have bright, playful colours and similar websites due to using the same Shopify templates.
            They can mainly be differentiated through product photos, typography, and logos,
            so one insight I realized was to use those elements to <strong>distinguish my client's website from her competitors.</strong>
            <br><br>For instance, my client wanted jewel tones or muted colours that weren’t too unapproachable.
            Based on the research insight, I suggested leaning into cooler or darker jewel tones to be visually distinctive from
            other brands.
        </p>

    <div class="body_content">
        <div class="project_text">
            <p>Similarly, since the template layout centered on product photos and couldn't largely be modified, my main design approach was to <strong>use colour as a tool
            to speak about the brand identity.</strong> To keep the website visually cohesive, I used colour continuity by <strong>pulling colours from the existing brand logos.</strong>
            This can be seen in the initial sketches, where I played with colour combinations with the purple and dark red shades from the logos.
            <br><br>Moreover, because I was concerned about readability⁠ and visual accessibility across mobile and desktop versions,
            I ran text and background colour combinations for all the iterative sketches through a <strong>colour contrast checker.</strong>
            This ensured the website colour theme met at least the level two Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

        <div class="project_text" style="width:100%">
            <p>Due to working with an existing website template, I couldn't implement total design overhauls for pain points I noticed,
                such as lackluster website navigation and the payment journey.
                However, I learned that some aspects could be improved by <strong>visually emphasizing, swapping,
                or changing specific website elements.</strong>The custom changes I made to the template included:</p><br>
                <li>Updating font types, font sizes, and colours to be more readable or accessibility friendly</li>
                <li>Updating menu layout and incorporating gradient backgrounds</li>
                <li>Embedding SBL Instagram posts in the website footer, which <strong>feature the founder and face of the brand</strong></li>
                <li>Designing and adding graphic elements</li>
            <br><p>Overall, these website customizations help <strong>humanize SBL more and allow personality to shine through.</strong>
            It also positions the brand as bold and vibrant in appearance, but also poetically sensual.
