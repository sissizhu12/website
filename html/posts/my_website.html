        <h1><br>how I designed (and coded) this site to be accessible</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 04, 2025 <br> 2 min read <br><br>
        <img src="/media/blog_posts/my_website/figma_screenshot.PNG" alt="hi" width="100%">
        <p>When creating this portfolio website from scratch, my initial goal was to leverage the
        full creative freedom to design and code a unique portfolio. I wanted to not only showcase my case
        studies and design skills, but also learn more about website navigation, design, and
        digital accessibility.</p>
        <p>Here's 3 ways I paid attention to accessibility, ordered in terms of impact.
        Notice visual design is not the first, because truly accessible design does not end at interface design.</p>

        <p>1. Code structure <br>
        Every so often, I update my knowledge of accessibility guidelines and website code best practices.
        And every so often, I improve my code to reflect my better understanding of WCAG and the lived experiences of people with disabilities.
        Moreover, when I first learned the basics of front-end coding 8 years ago, HTML and CSS looked very different then; another reason
        to review code to keep up with both technical and accessibility practices.</p>

        <p>2. Information architecture<br>
        Websites should be easy to navigate, whether it by sight, screenreader, or selection switches.
        With this mind, I spent time considering different ways to organize the site and minimize needing
        too many clicks to jump between webpages. This also included intentional content hierarchy on individual webpages,
        where high priority information lives closer to the top of the page.</p>

        <p>3. Interface design<br>
        Knowing about colour contrast and readable font styles is necessary as a designer, but it doesn't stop there.
        How is information being delivered? Is it through text, image, or video content? And is there a way to
        communicate information through more than one medium for accessibility? These are all questions I considered
        when designing this website, which is by all means not perfect, but getting there. 
        </p>

        <img src="/media/blog_posts/my_website/cycle.png" width="100%">
        <p>An unexpected outcome of crafting this site:
        Because I conducted all UX research, designing, and coding, I saw hidden connections
        between each role. This led me to better understand the worlds of design and code
        as collaborative rather than independent.</p>
        <p>This project made me appreciate both sides more, as I often moved back and forth between designing and
        coding, giving me new insights from one role to support the other. For instance, I found annotated sketches to be
        helpful visual guides for updating webpages. As a result, I also learned first-hand the communication value
        of clear design documentation for handoff to coders, and it motivates me to keep my developers on the same page for every project I take on.</p>
