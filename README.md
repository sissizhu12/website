## Welcomeâœ¨
This is the repository for [my personal website](https://sissizhu.com), which showcases my design portfolio as well as my skills in user experience design, web development, and web design accessibility. The website is currently deployed through GitHub pages.

I first designed the website in fall 2023 in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aGnxOnftLqZac9MUl4j80i/website?type=design&node-id=1%3A3&mode=design&t=q3U8uyM93M6HNRMC-1) and then built it out in HTML and CSS. I already had a basic foundation of HTML, CSS, and Figma and wanted to challenge myself to self-learn deeper since these technologies are continuously growing and updating. I also wanted to push myself to become re-familarized with JavaScript (technically my first coding language!!) for web and explore interface design with animations.

Through this project, I'm understanding the coding side of web development better as a user experience designer. I'm also learning that the two worlds of design and code are not dependent on each other, especially when it comes to creating truly accessible and inclusive design (which this is truthfully not there *yet!*).

This website is being continuously updated technically and design wise, so stay tuned for future updates! **Like most things in life, there's always more ways to improve and grow, one iteration at a time.** Feel free to [email me with feedback](mailto:sissizhu12@gmail.com), especially if you are a disabled person having trouble using my site!
