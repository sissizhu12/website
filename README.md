## Welcomeâœ¨
This is the repository for [my personal website](https://sissizhu.com), which showcases my design portfolio as well as my user experience design and web development skills. The website is currently deployed through GitHub pages.

I first designed the website in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aGnxOnftLqZac9MUl4j80i/website?type=design&node-id=1%3A3&mode=design&t=q3U8uyM93M6HNRMC-1) and then built it out in HTML and CSS. Although I already had a basic foundation of HTML, CSS, and Figma, I wanted to challenge myself to self-learn deeper since these technologies are continuously growing and updating. I also wanted to push myself to become re-familarized with JavaScript(technically my first coding language!!) for web and explore interface design with animations.

There's a lot of back and forth thinking between planning out the design and coding it, but I'm learning so much about the interplay of design and code in web development through this project! Overall, I'm understanding the coding side of web development better as a user experience designer and learning that the two worlds of design and code are not independent of each other. 

This website is being continuously updated, so stay tuned for future updates! I think that for both design and code, **there's always new improvements or iterative changes to try out.**
